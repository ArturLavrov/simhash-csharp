simhash-csharp
=================
This is a C# port of a very clear and concise simhash implementation in python 
(also on github at https://github.com/liangsun/simhash).  If you work in python I highly 
suggest you start with that one or the other python implementations.  

## Getting Started 

This project was written using Visual Studio 2015. In keeping with the *clean* implementation
there are no other external dependencies to build.  

## Issues

Currently there are no known issues.  

## Performance Optimization

Since some of the types from python to C# are exactly the same, performance might differ.  I
will be sending the C# code through a variety of a/b tests in the near future and will 
make sure to push those finding into the repository as needed.

## Contribute!

Let's make this a really awesome C# library.

## Database Backends

Work is currenly underway to implement multiple backend providers with this code.  This will
mimic the concepts around another popular simhash library (https://github.com/seomoz/simhash-db-py).
